# 2023 Fall CSE 101 PA7     


## Description:          
    
    In this project, I created a program that is very similar in operation
    to pa1, and this time in C++. The main program will be called Order.cpp, 
    and will use a Dictionary ADT based on a Binary Search Tree.


## Files:    
* README.md    
- Makefile 
* Dictionary.h    
- Dictionary.cpp
* DictionaryTest.cpp 
- Order.cpp    
   
   
## Build

    or
    
    $ make DictionaryTest     
    
   
## Running   
            
    $ ./Order <input file> <output file>        
    
    $ ./DictionaryTest            
       

## Cleaning
